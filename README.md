# GreenDesign
[Live Demo](http://faizanakram.me/GreenDesign)

This site is actually a PSD to HTML/CSS with some changes including making it responsive.
The original site was created by [The Net Ninja](http://thenetninja.co.uk)

At first I developed the site watching [this](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL4cUxeGkcC9jjVlRiZnRnAGFSCK3Lu_i-) tutorial series of [The Net Ninja](http://thenetninja.co.uk) but then I decided to change it and make it somewhat more beautiful and responsive. 

Thus, I used [bootstrap](http://getbootstrap.com) and some jQuery for this purpose.
